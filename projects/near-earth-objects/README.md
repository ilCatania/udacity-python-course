Near Earth Objects project
==========================

For this project, I wrote parsing logic to load
Near Earth object data from the NASA database
and query it according to several features.

My contributions are limited to changes in the 
following files:
```
database.py
extract.py
filters.py
models.py
```

For more details on the assignment, please see
the [`README-udacity.md`](./README-udacity.md)
file originally included with the project's 
starter code.
