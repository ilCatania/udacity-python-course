Intermediate Python Nanodegree - my code
========================================

This repository holds most of the code I wrote while
taking the
[Intermediate Python Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/intermediate-python-nanodegree--nd303)
course on the Udacity platform.
The course was split in two parts and consisted of a
series of lessons with exercises, and a final project
at the end of each part. The projects can be found in
the aptly named subfolder [`projects`](./projects)
and both have their own `README.md`.
